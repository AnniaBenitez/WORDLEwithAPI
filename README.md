# WORDLEwithAPI
The same wordle game, but this one uses apis to get random words. Sometimes it fails because of the api page, but it doesn't matter, instead, it uses a list in a
catch function :)
I used an animation for winners that i took from CodePen, link on animation: https://codepen.io/GhostRider/pen/ZEeYxE?editors=1111
Some extra decoration included, an attempts counter and a play again buttom.
Things like verifications for words length and other things.
For some reason, it looks better in mozilla firefox(?
